👋 I'm Event Sourcing and .NET OSS practician 👷

You may know me from my work as [Event Store](https://www.eventstore.com/) DevAdvocate, or co-maintainer of [Marten](https://martendb.io/), or from my [Event Sourcing in .NET tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore). We could meet after one of my conference talks or my online [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNrH5dK1m0I&list=PLw-VZz_H4iio9b_NrH25gPKjr2MAS2YgC) or we're just starting our friendship.

🔥 My mission is to build tools like [Marten](https://martendb.io/) or [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye) that will help to have fun while efficiently delivering systems to productions. I also want to pass my pragmatic approach and let others learn from my mistakes instead of their own.

My main projects:
- 🐉 [Event Store](https://www.eventstore.com/)
- 🐿️ [Marten](https://martendb.io/)
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in .NET tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore)
- 👁️ [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye)
- 🧰 [WebApi in .NET Core tutorials and samples](https://github.com/oskardudycz/WebApiWith.NETCore)

## Sponsorship

🙏 If you used my tools, learned from my resources and would like to help me make my community work sustainable - a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT. Github stars and Nuget downloads don't pay the bills. Hopefully, with your support, I'll be continuing my community work and do it not only in overtime 😛
