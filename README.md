👋 I'm Event Sourcing and .NET OSS practitioner 👷

You may know me from my [Event Sourcing tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore) or you've read my [blog](http://event-driven.io/?utm_source=github_profile). We could meet after one of my conference talks or my online [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNrH5dK1m0I&list=PLw-VZz_H4iio9b_NrH25gPKjr2MAS2YgC), or we're just starting our friendship.

🔥 My mission is to build tools to help have fun while efficiently delivering systems to productions. I also want to pass my pragmatic approach and let others learn from my mistakes instead of their own.

My main projects:
- 👨‍🔬 [Emmett - a Node.js library taking your event-driven applications back to the future!](https://github.com/event-driven-io/emmett/)
- 🐶 [Pongo - Mongo but on Postgres and with strong consistency benefits](https://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo/)
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in .NET tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore)
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in Node.js tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NodeJS)
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in Java tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.JVM)
- 📝 [Architecture Weekly Newsletter](https://github.com/oskardudycz/ArchitectureWeekly)

You can also check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskardudycz/).

I was involved in past in:
- 🐿️ [Marten](https://martendb.io/)
- 🐉 [EventStoreDB](https://developers.eventstore.com/)
- 👁️ [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye)

## Sponsorship

🙏 If you used my tools, learned from my resources and would like to help me make my community work sustainable - a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT. GitHub stars and Nuget downloads don't pay the bills. Hopefully, with your support, I'll be continuing my community work and do it not only in overtime 😛

You can support my work at [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oskardudycz).
