# Hi there, I'm Oskar Dudycz 👋

👋 I'm Event Sourcing and .NET OSS practician 👷

You may know me from my work as co-maintainer of [Marten](https://martendb.io/) work, or from my [Event Sourcing in .NET tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore). We could meet after one of my conference talks or my online [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNrH5dK1m0I&list=PLw-VZz_H4iio9b_NrH25gPKjr2MAS2YgC) or we're just starting our friendship.

🔥 My mission is to build tools like [Marten](https://martendb.io/) or [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye) that will help to have fun while efficiently delivering systems to productions. I also want to pass my pragmatic approach and let others learn from my mistakes instead of their own. I'm trying every day to make our developers community better.

My main projects:
- 🐿️ [Marten](https://martendb.io/)
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in .NET tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore)
- 👁️ [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye)

## Sponsorship

🙏 If you used my tools, learned from my resources and would like to help me make my community work sustainable - a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT. Github stars and Nuget downloads don't pay the bills. Hopefully, with your support, I'll be continuing my community work and do it not only in overtime 😛
